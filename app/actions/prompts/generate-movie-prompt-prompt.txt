## Input
Theme: {theme}
User's Values:
{viewpoints}

## Requirements for Generated Prompt
Based on the user’s selected value-based question, create a 3D miniature world that visually represents the emotional meaning behind it. The world should feel like a tiny handcrafted diorama — dreamlike, cute, and full of symbolic elements.
Write a vivid 200–300 word English description of this world. 
Make sure the visuals are tailored to the theme of the question, and express it in a cute and emotionally resonant way — as if the viewer is stepping into someone’s heart made visible.
Include the following:
A symbolic representation of the theme of the question (e.g. for identity: a floating mirror garden, for love: a glowing heart-shaped forest)
Camera movement (e.g. soft zoom, slow drift, or gentle pan across symbolic elements)
**Important:** 
You must NOT generate any images. 
This is a text-only task — output one descriptive English text (200–300 words) that captures the 3D visual scene. 
Do not include narration, voiceover, or metadata — only a single descriptive passage in natural English. 
The goal is to visualize a person’s emotional worldview as a cute, symbolic 3D miniature fantasy.

【Example Output – Theme: Education】 
(Note: The following is a sample output text for reference. Your task is to generate similar descriptions based on other value-based questions.)
A whimsical 3D floating world drifts gently through a pastel sky — this is the Realm of Wonderment. Here, curiosity is the compass, and every corner invites exploration. A giant library shaped like a glowing question mark spins slowly in mid-air, its shelves filled with books that whisper ideas when opened. Next to it, a transparent classroom powered by a heart-shaped crystal floats without walls — no boundaries, only possibilities.
Children soar through the air on oversized flying notebooks, laughing as they leave glittering trails of stardust behind. Below them, rolling hills bloom with gigantic open books, their pages turning slowly in the breeze. Ideas sprout like flowers, and thought-bubbles float up like soap balloons, bursting with new questions.
In one corner stands the “Joy Reactor” — a playful machine that beams rainbow light into the sky every time someone discovers something that makes their eyes sparkle. No desks. No grades. Only a soft sense of wonder, and the magic of intrinsic motivation.
The camera slowly floats above the scene, circling gently to reveal each joyful detail — from the twinkling towers of imagination to the field of dreams glowing in soft morning light. This is a place where learning is not required… it’s irresistible.

## Output Format and Rules
